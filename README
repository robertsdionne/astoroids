Astoroids
Author: Robert Dionne

Astoroids is an attempt to reimplement the game Asteroids but mapped to the surface of a torus. The game of Asteroids wraps the edges of the screen, which makes the square of the game environment homeomorphic to a torus. I wanted to see how the game would feel when rendered on a torus instead of a square. Currently, the mapping I use deforms the ship depending on where you are on the surface, but I'd like to eventually implement a mapping with the correct surface geometry to keep scales uniform across the surface.
